Resque Lock
===========

A [Resque][rq] plugin. Requires Resque 1.7.0.

If you want only one instance of your job queued at a time, extend it
with this module.


For example:

    require 'resque/plugins/queue/lock'

    class UpdateNetworkGraph
      extend Resque::Plugins::Queue::Lock

      def self.perform(repo_id)
        heavy_lifting
      end
    end

While this job is queued or running, no other UpdateNetworkGraph
jobs with the same arguments will be placed on the queue.

If you want to define the key yourself you can override the
`queue_lock` class method in your subclass, e.g.

    class UpdateNetworkGraph
      extend Resque::Plugins::Queue::Lock

      Run only one at a time, regardless of repo_id.
      def self.queue_lock(repo_id)
        "network-graph"
      end

      def self.perform(repo_id)
        heavy_lifting
      end
    end
